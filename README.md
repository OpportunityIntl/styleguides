# Styleguides
Keeping our developers all on the same page. See respective READMEs for language-specific guides:

- [CSS](https://github.com/OpportunityIntl/styleguides/blob/master/css.md)
- [HTML](https://github.com/OpportunityIntl/styleguides/blob/master/html.md)
- [JavaScript](https://github.com/OpportunityIntl/styleguides/blob/master/javascript.md)

##Comments
Comment, comment, comment. You might know what your code does now, but you won't remember a year from now, and other developers definitely won't.

##Editor settings

Using consistent editor settings will prevent dirty diffs.

- Use soft-tabs set to 2 spaces.
- Add new line at end of files (many IDEs do this automatically)
- Use UTF8 encoding
