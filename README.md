# Styleguides
Keeping our developers all on the same page

##Comments
Comment, comment, comment. You might know what your code does now, but you won't remember a year from now, and other developers definitely won't.

##Editor settings

- Use soft-tabs set to 2 spaces.
- Add new line at end of files (many IDEs do this automatically)
- Use UTF8 encoding
