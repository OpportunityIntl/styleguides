# Styleguides
Keeping our developers all on the same page. See respective READMEs for language-specific guides:

##Comments
Comment, comment, comment. You might know what your code does now, but you won't remember a year from now, and other developers definitely won't.

##Editor settings

Using consistent editor settings will prevent dirty diffs.

- Use soft-tabs set to 2 spaces. Soft tabs are the only way to guarantee code renders the same in any environment. Two spaces is a matter of preference, but [I'm the decider](https://i.chzbgr.com/maxW500/1353310976/h52166690/).
- Add new line at end of files (many IDEs do this automatically)
- Use UTF8 encoding
