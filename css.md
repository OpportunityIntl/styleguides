#CSS Styleguide

Based off [@mdo Code Guide](http://mdo.github.io/code-guide/), which itself is based off of [Idiomatic CSS](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css) and [GitHub Styleguide](http://github.com/styleguide)

##Syntax

- Use soft tabs with two spaces—they're the only way to guarantee code renders the same in any environment.
- When grouping selectors, keep individual selectors to a single line.
- Include one space before the opening brace of declaration blocks for legibility.
- Place closing braces of declaration blocks on a new line.
- Include one space after `:` for each declaration.
- Each declaration should appear on its own line for more accurate error reporting.
- End all declarations with a semi-colon. The last declaration's is optional, but your code is more error prone without it.
- Comma-separated property values should include a space after each comma (e.g., `box-shadow`).
- Don't include spaces after commas within `rgb()`, `rgba()`, `hsl()`, `hsla()`, or `rect()` values. This helps differentiate multiple color values (comma, no space) from multiple property values (comma with space).
- Lowercase all hex values, e.g., `#fff`. Lowercase letters are much easier to discern when scanning a document as they tend to have more unique shapes.
- Use shorthand hex values where available, e.g., `#fff` instead of `#ffffff`.
- Quote attribute values in selectors, e.g., `input[type="text"]`. [They’re only optional in some cases](http://mathiasbynens.be/notes/unquoted-attribute-values#css), and it’s a good practice for consistency.
- Avoid specifying units for zero values, e.g., `margin: 0;` instead of `margin: 0px;`.
- Questions on the terms used here? See the [syntax section of the Cascading Style Sheets article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#Syntax) on Wikipedia.

```CSS
/* Bad CSS */
.selector, .selector-secondary, .selector[type=text] {
  padding:15px;
  margin:0px 0px 15px;
  background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
  box-shadow:0px 1px 2px #CCC,inset 0 1px 0 #FFFFFF
}

/* Good CSS */
.selector,
.selector-secondary,
.selector[type="text"] {
  padding: 15px;
  margin-bottom: 15px;
  background-color: rgba(0,0,0,.5);
  box-shadow: 0 1px 2px #ccc, inset 0 1px 0 #fff;
}
```

##Declaration order

_Note: not sure how I feel about this section._

Related property declarations should be grouped together following the order:

- Positioning
- Box model
- Typographic
- Visual
- Positioning comes first because it can remove an element from the normal flow of the document and override box model related styles. The box model comes next as it dictates a component's dimensions and placement.

Everything else takes place inside the component or without impacting the previous two sections, and thus they come last.

For a complete list of properties and their order, please see [Recess](http://twitter.github.com/recess).

```CSS
.declaration-order {
  /* Positioning */
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  right: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  left: 0;
  z-index: 100;

  /* Box-model */
  display: block;
  float: right;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;

  /* Typography */
  font: normal 13px "Helvetica Neue", sans-serif;
  line-height: 1.5;
  color: #333;
  text-align: center;

  /* Visual */
  background-color: #f5f5f5;
  border: 1px solid #e5e5e5;
  border-radius: 3px;

  /* Misc */
  opacity: 1;
}
```

##Don't use `@import`

Compared to `<link>`s, `@import` is slower, adds extra page requests, and can cause other unforeseen problems. Avoid them and instead opt for an alternate approach:

- Use multiple `<link>` elements
- Compile your CSS with a preprocessor like Sass or Less into a single file
- Concatenate your CSS files with features provided in Rails, Jekyll, and other environments

##Media query placement

Place media queries as close to their relevant rule sets whenever possible. Don't bundle them all in a separate stylesheet or at the end of the document. Doing so only makes it easier for folks to miss them in the future. Here's a typical setup.

```CSS
.element { ... }
.element-avatar { ... }
.element-selected { ... }

@media (min-width: 480px) {
  .element { ...}
  .element-avatar { ... }
  .element-selected { ... }
}
```

##Prefixed properties

When using vendor prefixed properties, indent each property such that the declaration's value lines up vertically for easy multi-line editing.

```CSS
/* Prefixed properties */
.selector {
  -webkit-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.15);
          box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.15);
}
```

##Single declarations

In instances where a rule set includes only one declaration, consider removing line breaks for readability and faster editing. Any rule set with multiple declarations should be split to separate lines.

The key factor here is error detection — e.g., a CSS validator stating you have a syntax error on Line 183. With a single declaration, there's no missing it. With multiple declarations, separate lines is a must for your sanity.

```CSS
/* Single declarations on one line */
.span1 { width: 60px; }
.span2 { width: 140px; }
.span3 { width: 220px; }

/* Multiple declarations, one per line */
.sprite {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 16px;
  height: 15px;
  background-image: url(../img/sprite.png);
}
.icon           { background-position: 0 0; }
.icon-home      { background-position: 0 -20px; }
.icon-account   { background-position: 0 -40px; }
```

##Shorthand notation

Strive to limit use of shorthand declarations to instances where you must explicitly set all the available values. Common overused shorthand properties include:

- `padding`
- `margin`
- `font`
- `background`
- `border`
- `border-radius`

Often times we don't need to set all the values a shorthand property represents. For example, HTML headings only set top and bottom margin, so when necessary, only override those two values. Excessive use of shorthand properties often leads to sloppier code with unnecessary overrides and unintended side effects.

The Mozilla Developer Network has a great article on [shorthand properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Shorthand_properties) for those unfamiliar with notation and behavior.

```CSS
/* Bad example */
.element {
  margin: 0 0 10px;
  background: red;
  background: url("image.jpg");
  border-radius: 3px 3px 0 0;
}

/* Good example */
.element {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  background-color: red;
  background-image: url("image.jpg");
  border-top-left-radius: 3px;
  border-top-right-radius: 3px;
}
```

##Nesting in Less and Sass

Avoid unnecessary nesting. Just because you can nest, doesn't mean you always should. If you're nesting more than 3 levels deep, you're probably doing something wrong.

##Comments
_Add guidelines on comments here_

##Class names

- Keep classes lowercase and use dashes (not underscores or camelCase). Dashes serve as natural breaks in related class (e.g., `.btn` and `.btn-danger`).
- Avoid excessive and arbitrary shorthand notation. `.btn` is useful for button, but `.s` doesn't mean anything.
- Keep classes as short and succinct as possible.

It's also useful to apply many of these same rules when creating Sass and Less variable names.

##Editor preferences

Set your editor to the following settings to avoid common code inconsistencies and dirty diffs:

- Use soft-tabs set to two spaces.
- Trim trailing white space on save.
- Set encoding to UTF-8.
- Add new line at end of files.
