#CSS Styleguide

Based off [@mdo Code Guide](http://mdo.github.io/code-guide/), which itself is based off of [Idiomatic CSS](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css) and [GitHub Styleguide](http://github.com/styleguide)

##Syntax

- Use soft tabs with two spaces—they're the only way to guarantee code renders the same in any environment.
- When grouping selectors, keep individual selectors to a single line.
- Include one space before the opening brace of declaration blocks for legibility.
- Place closing braces of declaration blocks on a new line.
- Include one space after `:` for each declaration.
- Each declaration should appear on its own line for more accurate error reporting.
- End all declarations with a semi-colon. The last declaration's is optional, but your code is more error prone without it.
- Comma-separated property values should include a space after each comma (e.g., `box-shadow`).
- Don't include spaces after commas within `rgb()`, `rgba()`, `hsl()`, `hsla()`, or `rect()` values. This helps differentiate multiple color values (comma, no space) from multiple property values (comma with space).
- Lowercase all hex values, e.g., `#fff`. Lowercase letters are much easier to discern when scanning a document as they tend to have more unique shapes.
- Use shorthand hex values where available, e.g., `#fff` instead of `#ffffff`.
- Quote attribute values in selectors, e.g., `input[type="text"]`. [They’re only optional in some cases](http://mathiasbynens.be/notes/unquoted-attribute-values#css), and it’s a good practice for consistency.
- Avoid specifying units for zero values, e.g., `margin: 0;` instead of `margin: 0px;`.
- Questions on the terms used here? See the [syntax section of the Cascading Style Sheets article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#Syntax) on Wikipedia.

```CSS
/* Bad CSS */
.selector, .selector-secondary, .selector[type=text] {
  padding:15px;
  margin:0px 0px 15px;
  background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
  box-shadow:0px 1px 2px #CCC,inset 0 1px 0 #FFFFFF
}

/* Good CSS */
.selector,
.selector-secondary,
.selector[type="text"] {
  padding: 15px;
  margin-bottom: 15px;
  background-color: rgba(0,0,0,.5);
  box-shadow: 0 1px 2px #ccc, inset 0 1px 0 #fff;
}
```

##Declaration order

Related property declarations should be grouped together following the order:

- Positioning
- Box model
- Typographic
- Visual
- Positioning comes first because it can remove an element from the normal flow of the document and override box model related styles. The box model comes next as it dictates a component's dimensions and placement.

Everything else takes place inside the component or without impacting the previous two sections, and thus they come last.

For a complete list of properties and their order, please see [Recess](http://twitter.github.com/recess).

```CSS
.declaration-order {
  /* Positioning */
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  right: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  left: 0;
  z-index: 100;

  /* Box-model */
  display: block;
  float: right;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;

  /* Typography */
  font: normal 13px "Helvetica Neue", sans-serif;
  line-height: 1.5;
  color: #333;
  text-align: center;

  /* Visual */
  background-color: #f5f5f5;
  border: 1px solid #e5e5e5;
  border-radius: 3px;

  /* Misc */
  opacity: 1;
}
```

##Don't use `@import`

Compared to `<link>`s, `@import` is slower, adds extra page requests, and can cause other unforeseen problems. Avoid them and instead opt for an alternate approach:

- Use multiple `<link>` elements
- Compile your CSS with a preprocessor like Sass or Less into a single file
- Concatenate your CSS files with features provided in Rails, Jekyll, and other environments

##Media query placement

Place media queries as close to their relevant rule sets whenever possible. Don't bundle them all in a separate stylesheet or at the end of the document. Doing so only makes it easier for folks to miss them in the future. Here's a typical setup.

```CSS
.element { ... }
.element-avatar { ... }
.element-selected { ... }

@media (min-width: 480px) {
  .element { ...}
  .element-avatar { ... }
  .element-selected { ... }
}
```
